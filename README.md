# Process:
1. Websraping Data from the webpage https://www.watchcollecting.com
<br/>
Code is in ```rolexVer009.py```
The path needs to be setup here: ```service = Service('/usr/local/bin/chromedriver')```
The data are saved into file ```dataAutoVer009.csv```

2. Websraping Data from the webpage https://www.ofx.com/en-us/forex-news/historical-exchange-rates/
<br/>
Code is in ```currencypaul002.py```
<br/>
At the beginning the data are reading from file ```data\dataAutoVer009.csv```
At the end the updated data are exported into file ```dataWithCurrencyVer002.csv```

3. Code for data cleaning and preparing is in `cleaningRolexVer011WholeCode.py`

At the beginning the data are reading from file `dataWithCurrencyVer002.csv`
At the end the updated data are exported into file `reformatedAndOneHotEncodedDataVer011.csv`

4. Model is created in the Jupiter Notebook: 
<br/>
```Watches_Model.ipynb```
Model code is exported in ```watches_lgbm_initial_model.pkl```

5. Code for application is in files:
<br/>
```server.py```
<br/>

# Troubleshooting tips:

1. Download and install the latest Chrome and check your Chrome version
2. Download the Chrome WebDriver Zip File matching with your Chrome version and Apple Chip from ```https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html``` and extract the chromedriver
3. Copy the chromedriver and paste it to ```/usr/local/bin``` (If this folder doesnâ€™t exist then create one)
4. Open a terminal inside the bin folder and run the following command so that MacOS can verify the app.
```
cd /usr/local/bin
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine chromedriver
```
5. Install Selenium:
